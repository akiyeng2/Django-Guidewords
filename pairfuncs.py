#This is a version of Swiss pairings with repeats OK. Currently, it assumes that the list of players is ordered by standing, and that each player is a tuple, with name as the first element and "score" (win = 1 pt., tie = 1/2 pt., loss = 0 pt.) as the second element.

#This is in progress!
#This Swiss algorithm copies the one from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28629235/swiss-tournament-pairing-algorithm .
